# EzQuiz Development Guide

This document provides instructions for developing the EzQuiz Android application, an advanced quiz learning app with features for creating, editing, importing, and studying quiz collections.

## Project Overview

EzQuiz is a comprehensive quiz application that allows users to:
- Create and edit quiz collections
- Support multiple quiz types (single choice, multiple choice, text input)
- Import quizzes from external sources like Quizlet
- Practice quizzes with advanced learning features

## Core Features

### 1. Quiz Collections Management
- Create new quiz collections
- Edit existing collections
- Delete collections
- Browse and search collections

### 2. Quiz Types Support
- Single choice questions
- Multiple choice questions
- Text input questions

### 3. External Import
- Import quiz sets from Quizlet
- Parse and convert external formats to app's data model

### 4. Advanced Play Mode
- **Retry Mode**: Failed quizzes will repeat at the end of the session
- **Shuffle Mode**: Randomized quiz order for better learning
- **Spaced Repetition**: Intelligent scheduling of quizzes based on performance

## Project Structure

The application follows MVVM architecture and is organized into the following main components:

### Data Layer
- **Model**: Core data entities representing quizzes and collections
- **Repository**: Data access interfaces and implementations
- **Data Sources**: Local (Room) and remote (Quizlet) data providers

### Domain Layer
- Business logic for quiz management, play sessions, and importing

### UI Layer
- Activities and Fragments providing the user interface
- ViewModels handling UI-related data and logic

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Database Setup

Implement the Room database to store quiz collections, individual quizzes, and user progress:

1. Complete the `QuizDatabase.java` class with proper entities and DAOs
2. Implement type converters for complex data types
3. Set up database migrations strategy

### Step 2: Repository Implementation

Create concrete implementations of the repository interfaces:

1. Implement `LocalQuizCollectionRepository.java`
2. Implement `LocalQuizRepository.java`
3. Add methods for searching and filtering quizzes

### Step 3: Quizlet Integration

Implement the import functionality using Retrofit and Jsoup:

1. Complete `QuizletService.java` with API endpoints
2. Implement HTML parsing for Quizlet data extraction
3. Create converters between Quizlet format and app's data model

### Step 4: Play Session Logic

Implement the quiz play mode with advanced learning features:

1. Develop the spaced repetition algorithm in `PlaySessionManager.java`
2. Implement shuffle and retry functionality
3. Create the progress tracking system

### Step 5: UI Implementation

Develop the user interface for all app features:

1. Create layouts for all fragments
2. Implement ViewModels with LiveData for reactive UI updates
3. Create adapters for RecyclerViews
4. Implement navigation between screens

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test repository implementations, quiz logic, and algorithms
2. **Integration Tests**: Test database operations and retrofit services
3. **UI Tests**: Validate user flows with Espresso

## Best Practices

1. Follow SOLID principles throughout the codebase
2. Use dependency injection for cleaner component relationships
3. Implement proper error handling and offline support
4. Add comprehensive logging for debugging
5. Follow material design guidelines for the UI

## Dependencies

The app uses the following key libraries:

- **AndroidX**: Core, AppCompat, Fragment
- **UI**: Material Components, ConstraintLayout, RecyclerView, ViewPager2
- **Architecture**: ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation
- **Database**: Room
- **Networking**: Retrofit, OkHttp, Jsoup
- **JSON Processing**: Gson
- **Image Loading**: Glide
- **Background Processing**: WorkManager

## Next Steps

1. Start with implementing the data layer
2. Move to business logic implementation
3. Create UI components and connect them with ViewModels
4. Implement the import functionality
5. Add the play mode with learning features
6. Polish the UI and add animations
7. Implement comprehensive error handling
8. Add analytics to track user learning progress
